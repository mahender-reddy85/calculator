# Mobile Responsiveness and Aesthetics Improvements for Calculator

## Information Gathered
- **HTML Structure**: Complex layout with sidebar, main calculator container, right panel for history/graphing. Uses Tailwind CSS and custom styles.
- **CSS**: Existing responsive design with media queries for 1024px, 768px, 480px. Supports dark/light themes. Buttons and containers have basic styling.
- **JS**: Handles calculator logic, themes, modals, graphing. No changes needed for styling.
- **Current Issues**: Layout may not be optimal on very small screens; aesthetics could be enhanced with gradients, animations, and better shadows.

## Plan
### 1. Improve Mobile Responsiveness
- Adjust media query breakpoints for better coverage (e.g., add 600px for tablets).
- Ensure sidebar stacks vertically on mobile and is fully accessible.
- Make calculator container and buttons more touch-friendly (min 44px height/width).
- Optimize right panel layout for mobile (stack elements vertically).
- Improve modal responsiveness (full width on mobile, larger inputs/buttons).

### 2. Enhance Aesthetics
- Add gradient backgrounds to key elements (sidebar, calculator container, buttons).
- Implement smooth hover and active animations for buttons.
- Enhance shadows and borders for depth.
- Improve color scheme for better contrast and visual appeal.
- Add subtle animations for theme transitions.

### 3. Additional Improvements
- Ensure consistent spacing and padding across devices.
- Optimize font sizes for readability on small screens.
- Add loading animations for better UX.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- `calculator.css`: Primary file for all styling changes.

## Followup Steps
- Test on various devices/screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Verify touch interactions work smoothly.
- Check accessibility (contrast, focus indicators).
- Ensure no performance issues with added animations.

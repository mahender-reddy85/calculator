# Mobile Responsiveness and Aesthetics Improvements for Calculator

## Information Gathered
- **HTML Structure**: Complex layout with sidebar, main calculator container, right panel for history/graphing. Uses Tailwind CSS and custom styles.
- **CSS**: Existing responsive design with media queries for 1024px, 768px, 480px. Supports dark/light themes. Buttons and containers have basic styling.
- **JS**: Handles calculator logic, themes, modals, graphing. No changes needed for styling.
- **Current Issues**: Layout may not be optimal on very small screens; aesthetics could be enhanced with gradients, animations, and better shadows.

## Plan

### 2. Enhance Aesthetics
